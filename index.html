				<p> For the past three months, I have been looking at how news is consumed, both on a personal and societal level. 
				I set out trying to discover something about the way that I got my news, and moved toward discoveries about how we, 
				as a society, consume our news. I welcome you to the page and invite you to contemplate your own news consumption.

			<h2>My Personal News Consumption</h2>
			<section id="personal">
				
				<div class="content">
					<p> In order to learn about my own news consumption, I designed a way to collect data. I decided to look at the 
					emotions that I felt while I was reading the news. After taking the data on my emotions, I designed a visual to 
					show how they related to one another. Through this, I was able to see connections between the emotions I felt, their 
					intensity, and the category of news consumed. Being a political scientist, it is not surprising for me to notice that 
					most of the news I read is about politics.  What did stick out to me was the mass amount of negative emotions that I 
					felt during my week. It is common knowledge that 2017 has been a year of political interest. With the election of Donald
					Trump in 2016, the political world has sort of been put on its head. The division in politics has lead many, including 
					including myself, to be disappointed in the news that we read. </p>

			<h2>The Mass Consumption of News</h2>

					<p> Learning how to consume news is something that everyone should be taught how to do in high school. It is important in 
					order for civil society to function. The goal of civil society in the United States is to educate citizens on how to participate 
					in the society. This includes being aware of what is going on in the world. As I looked into my own news consumption, I thought
					about all the claims of fake news that have been spread around since the 2016 election. It occurred to me that some people 
					do not know how to spot fake news. In order to discover for myself what fake news was, I decided to make a video discussing the
					rise of fake news and how to spot it. I hope that anyone watching will be able to learn how to spot fake news in their own 
					news consumption. I implore everyone in the world to take a look at how they consume the news. I ask them to think about what 
					they can do in order to be a better member of society. I ask that they try to educate themselves to the best of their abilities 
					on the issues of the day and how to solve them. All of this can be accomplished by looking at news, and all of it will help lead 
					to a better society. </p>
